- Zalith Launcher is a Minecraft launcher based on [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher) that runs [Minecraft: Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/) on Android devices.
- Zalith Launcher aims to enhance user experience by redesigning the app interface, adding more practical features, and lowering the barrier to entry, making it easier for more people to enjoy Minecraft.
